Before we dive into the code, let's briefly explain Big O notation and the different cases for search operations:

Big O Notation
Big O notation describes the upper limit of the time complexity of an algorithm as the input size grows. It provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm's performance.

Search Operations Scenarios
Best Case: The scenario where the search completes in the least amount of time. For example, in a linear search, this happens if the target element is the first element in the array.
Average Case: The average scenario considering all possible inputs. For linear search, it's the middle element.
Worst Case: The scenario where the search takes the maximum amount of time. In linear search, this is when the target element is the last or not present.

Compare Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n) in the worst case. It goes through each element until it finds the target or exhausts the array.
Binary Search: O(log n) in the worst case. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
Suitability for the Platform
Binary search is generally more suitable for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity. However, it requires the data to be sorted. Linear search, while less efficient for large datasets, does not require sorted data and might be preferable for smaller datasets or when the overhead of sorting is significant.
