Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive function calculateFutureValue is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of periods. This is because the function is called recursively once per period.
Optimization:

Memoization: Store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations. This technique helps reduce the time complexity significantly.
Iterative Approach: For this specific problem, an iterative approach might be more efficient since each step only requires a constant amount of work.
