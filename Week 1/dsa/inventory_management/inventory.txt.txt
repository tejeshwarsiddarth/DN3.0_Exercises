Time Complexity Analysis
Add Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1) on average (due to hash table).
Update Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1) on average (direct access via hash table and updating attributes).
Delete Operation:
Time Complexity: O(1) on average (removal from hash table).
Optimization Discussion
Efficient Hash Function: Ensure the hash function distributes products uniformly to minimize collisions.
Load Factor Management: Monitor the load factor of the hash table and resize it when necessary to maintain O(1) performance.
Lazy Deletion: Implement lazy deletion to handle deletion in constant time without immediate rehashing, deferring the cleanup to a later time.
